# HyperParameter Optimization Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost
- **Models :** - Decision Tree  
               - Random Forest  
               - AdaBoost (Boosting Algorithm)  
               - XGBoost (Boosting Algorithm)  
- **STEPS**:  
            - Firstly, We used the general models to classify and **Evaluate** the performance of the models  
            - Then we precisely Tuning the parameters of those model and **Evaluate** their performance
